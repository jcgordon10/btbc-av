# Soundboard

Welcome to the Church AV Team! As an AV tech, one of your main responsibilities is to operate the soundboard during worship services. This tutorial will guide you through the steps for operating the soundboard during soundcheck and the service.

## Soundcheck

1. Arrive at the church at least an hour before the service starts.
2. Meet with the worship team and ask them which instruments and microphones they will be using during the service.
3. Connect the instruments and microphones to the soundboard and make sure they are working properly.
4. Ask the worship team to play a song or two so you can adjust the levels of each instrument and microphone.
5. Use the faders on the soundboard to adjust the levels of each instrument and microphone until they sound balanced and clear.
6. Save the settings for each instrument and microphone on the soundboard so you can recall them during the service.

## Operating the Soundboard during the Service

1. When the service starts, turn on the soundboard and set the levels for any pre-service music or announcements.
2. Be alert and attentive throughout the service, making sure that the sound levels are consistent and appropriate for each song or speaker.
3. Use the faders on the soundboard to adjust the levels of each instrument and microphone as needed.
4. If feedback occurs, use the equalizer on the soundboard to remove the frequency that is causing the feedback.
5. Keep an eye on the soundboard throughout the service to make sure that the levels are consistent and no technical issues arise.
6. After the service, turn off the soundboard and disconnect any instruments and microphones.

1. Familiarize yourself with the soundboard ahead of time so you are comfortable with its features and functions.
2. Be sure to communicate with the worship team and other AV techs to ensure that everyone is on the same page.
3. Be prepared to troubleshoot any technical issues that arise during the service.
